A command/script builder configured by `YAML`_, based on `PhpZone`_. Its primary purpose is to
provide an easy way to define multiple scripts used in daily workflow of every developer.

Basic Usage
-----------

An example speaks a hundred words so letâ€™s go through one.

The configuration file below is used for the development of this extension:

.. literalinclude:: ../../phpzone.yml
    :language: yaml

Now we can just run following command and all tests would be executed:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vendor/bin/phpzone tests
